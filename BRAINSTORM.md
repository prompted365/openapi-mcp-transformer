# OpenAPI MCP Transformer - Brainstorming & Design

## Vision

Transform OpenAPI specifications into intelligent, autonomous MCP servers that go beyond simple tool mapping. These servers will be:

- **Context-Aware**: Understanding their environment through roots
- **Intelligent**: Making decisions through sampling
- **Adaptive**: Adjusting behavior based on context and results
- **Autonomous**: Handling complex workflows without constant guidance

## Core Innovations

### 1. Intelligent Spec Analysis

Instead of blindly mapping endpoints to tools, we'll analyze the OpenAPI spec to understand:

- **API Intent**: What is this API designed to do?
- **Workflow Patterns**: Common sequences of operations
- **Data Relationships**: How resources connect
- **Business Logic**: Implicit rules and constraints
- **Error Patterns**: Common failure modes and recovery strategies

### 2. Context-Driven Architecture

The server will maintain multiple layers of context:

- **Root Context**: Environment, tenant, configuration from roots
- **API Context**: Current state, authentication, rate limits
- **Workflow Context**: Active operations, dependencies, history
- **User Context**: Preferences, expertise level, goals

### 3. Autonomous Decision Engine

Using sampling, the server will:

- **Plan Operations**: Decompose complex requests into steps
- **Optimize Execution**: Batch operations, parallelize when possible
- **Handle Errors**: Intelligent retry and recovery strategies
- **Learn Patterns**: Recognize and optimize repeated workflows
- **Provide Insights**: Analyze results and suggest improvements

### 4. Dynamic Capability Evolution

The server adapts its capabilities based on:

- **Available Roots**: Different features for different environments
- **User Expertise**: Simpler or more advanced interfaces
- **API Evolution**: Automatically handle version changes
- **Usage Patterns**: Optimize for common workflows
